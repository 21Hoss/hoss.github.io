# About Me

I'm Kelvin Muhoro, also known as hoss, a 25-year-old guy from Kenya who has a lot of passion and hunger for cybersecurity. Below is my timeline of my ethical hacking journey:

From 2019 to 2024, I'm just a person who learns how to find a bug in websites for around 12 hours every day. During that time period, I also self-taught python scripting, bug bounties, reading programming codes (Not writing codes) and more. In mid-2023, I started to plan my future, like what career path I should take.

In around mid January 2023, I was randomly watching YouTube videos, and suddenly I saw [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck)'s video talking about [password cracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_oqTZJqCo). By watching his video, it caught my eye balls. I was fascinated in ethical hacking and tried to follow his tutorials to build a virtual environment, installing Kali Linux, cracking passwords with [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/). And this is how my ethical hacking journey starts!

I started to learn ethical hacking much deeper, and registered a [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/21Hoss) account and learning all the fundamentals from scratch, and constantly writing CTF writeups, taking part in CTF competitions, and so on.
